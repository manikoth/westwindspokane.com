						<h2>Facilties</h2>
						<p>We have been involved with dogs for over 40 years.  We built and designed the dog kennels and cattery with our customers and their pets comfort in mind.  We offer “houses” for the dogs which we feel give the dogs privacy and allows owners to bring bedding from home.  We feel that this helps reduce stress and creates a comfortable environment.</p> 
						<p>We are built according to Spokane County regulations for dog kennels.  The dogs always have access to a run area that is fully enclosed and protected from the weather.  Our 100 runs are housed in 3 separate buildings, therefore reducing the dog density.  We are licensed and inspected yearly by Spokane County Animal and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
	 					<p>We pride ourselves on our clean professionally run facility.  We take pride in being  family owned and operated.   We offer reasonable rates.  When thinking of boarding your pets, we encourage new customers to tour our kennels as well as others so you know you have made the right decision. </p>

						<p>West Wind Kennels was opened in the fall of 1979 by Gary &amp; Vicki Erickson. We started out with just twelve runs and trained working dogs. Gary traveled throughout the Northwest and Canada competing in field trials. As time went on, we did less training and more and more boarding. We have now expanded our facilities to over 100 dog kennels and 32 kitty condos and only train our personal pets.</p>

						<p>Renovations and up dating have been ongoing since we opened. Our goal has always been to provide quality care in a safe environment for your pet. In keeping with that theme we feed Atta Boy to the dogs and Kirkland dry cat chow to the kitties. For those discriminating eaters you are more than welcome to bring your own food and there is no extra charge for special feeding.</p>

						<p>We know that your pet is a valued member of your family. Rest assured that all of us here at West Wind Kennels are committed to doing everything we can to make your pet's stay as safe, comfortable and enjoyable as possible.</p>
